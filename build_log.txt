If a package in a merged underlay workspace is overridden and it installs headers, then all packages in the overlay must sort their include directories by workspace order. Failure to do so may result in build failures or undefined behavior at run time.
If the overridden package is used by another package in any underlay, then the overriding package in the overlay must be API and ABI compatible or undefined behavior at run time may occur.

If you understand the risks and want to override a package anyways, add the following to the command line:
	--allow-overriding moveit_common moveit_configs_utils moveit_core moveit_kinematics moveit_planners moveit_ros_move_group moveit_ros_planning moveit_ros_planning_interface moveit_ros_visualization moveit_ros_warehouse moveit_simple_controller_manager

This may be promoted to an error in a future release of colcon-override-check.

  By not providing "Findament_cmake_google_benchmark.cmake" in
  CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has asked CMake to find a package
  configuration file provided by "ament_cmake_google_benchmark", but CMake
  did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by
  "ament_cmake_google_benchmark" with any of the following names:

    ament_cmake_google_benchmarkConfig.cmake
    ament_cmake_google_benchmark-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "ament_cmake_google_benchmark" to
  CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set "ament_cmake_google_benchmark_DIR" to a directory
  containing one of the above files.  If "ament_cmake_google_benchmark"
  provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has been
  installed.
